# KiCad Design Examples

This repository contains KiCad circuit designs created in an effort to highlight some aspects of KiCad features and their practical use for various types of circuit design. 


## [DEX_MRHW0000 - basic line filter](dex0000_mains_filter/readme.md) 

A simple line filter circuit implements individual clearances for phase-to-neutral, mains-to-earth, and earth to PCB edge, as well as small self-clearance for nets that share the same DC potential, but may be split to account for AC behavior, in this case of a common-mode choke.
